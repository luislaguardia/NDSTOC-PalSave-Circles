#  DICL-Model (Data-Informed Credit Logic)

This directory contains the implementation of the **Alternative Credit Scoring** model used in the **PalSave Circles** platform. It analyzes users' financial behavior within Paluwagan circles to generate a creditworthiness score, especially for users without traditional financial histories.

---

##  What This Model Does

- Tracks **user contribution patterns** within savings circles.
- Evaluates **consistency**, **timeliness**, and **circle reliability**.
- Uses **machine learning** (e.g., Random Forest) to predict credit behavior.
- Provides a **credit score** based on user trustworthiness and participation.

---

##  Model Type (Current)

The current implementation uses a **Random Forest Classifier**, a supervised learning model that performs well with structured behavioral data.

### Features Used:
- `total_contributions`
- `on_time_payments`
- `late_payments`
- `number_of_circles_joined`
- `average_contribution_amount`
- `dropout_rate`

### Target:
- `is_trustworthy` → Boolean (1 for good standing, 0 otherwise)

##  How to Run

You can run the credit scoring model using Docker for easy setup.

###  Prerequisites

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

###  Steps to Run with Docker

1. **Navigate to the DICL-Model folder:**
   ```bash
   cd NDSTOC-PalSave-Circles/DICL-Model
   ```
2. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t dicl-model .
   ```
3. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 dicl-model
   ```
4. **Open the app in your browser:**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5000
   ```
##  Future Work

- Integrate scoring output into the **PalSave** dashboard  
- Expand feature set with more behavioral and financial indicators  
- Compare multiple ML models (e.g., **XGBoost**, **Logistic Regression**, etc.)  
- Link scores with potential **micro-lending APIs**
