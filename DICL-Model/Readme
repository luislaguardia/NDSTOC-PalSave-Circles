# 🤖 DICL-Model (Data-Informed Credit Logic)

This directory contains the implementation of the **Alternative Credit Scoring** model used in the **PalSave Circles** platform. It analyzes users' financial behavior within Paluwagan circles to generate a creditworthiness score, especially for users without traditional financial histories.

---

## 📊 What This Model Does

- Tracks **user contribution patterns** within savings circles.
- Evaluates **consistency**, **timeliness**, and **circle reliability**.
- Uses **machine learning** (e.g., Random Forest) to predict credit behavior.
- Provides a **credit score** based on user trustworthiness and participation.

---

## 🧠 Model Type (Current)

The current implementation uses a **Random Forest Classifier**, a supervised learning model that performs well with structured behavioral data.

### Features Used:
- `total_contributions`
- `on_time_payments`
- `late_payments`
- `number_of_circles_joined`
- `average_contribution_amount`
- `dropout_rate`

### Target:
- `is_trustworthy` → Boolean (1 for good standing, 0 otherwise)
