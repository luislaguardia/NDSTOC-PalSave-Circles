# ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Many Filipinos lack access to formal banking and credit systems, preventing them from building credit scores or securing loans.

**Goal:**  
Modernize the traditional *Paluwagan* savings system and provide a behavior-based alternative credit scoring mechanism to promote financial inclusion.

This system empowers unbanked and underbanked communities by turning consistent participation into data-driven trust.
