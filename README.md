# NDSTOC-PalSave-Circles

**PalSave Circles** is a digital platform that modernizes the traditional Filipino *Paluwagan* system. It allows users to join or create savings circles, manage contributions, and build an alternative credit score based on their financial behavior within these groups.

##  Project Overview

**Paluwagan** is a community-based informal savings method popular in the Philippines, where members contribute a fixed amount regularly, and one member receives the total pot in each round. 

This platform enhances Paluwagan with the following features:
-  Circle Creation & Joining
-  Contribution Tracking
-  Activity Monitoring
-  Financial Transparency

##  DICL-Model (Data-Informed Credit Logic)

Located in the `/DICL-Model` directory, this component is designed to provide **Alternative Credit Scoring** using machine learning.

Key highlights:
-  Utilizes user behavior within Paluwagan circles (e.g., consistency, timeliness of contributions) as credit indicators.
-  May include models such as **Random Forest** or others for scoring, classification, or prediction. *(To confirm exact model used, refer to the model code within the DICL-Model directory.)*

This model allows the app to:
- Provide a **creditworthiness score** for users without traditional credit histories.
- Enable potential integration with lending institutions or peer-to-peer lending platforms.

##  Why Alternative Credit Scoring?

Traditional financial institutions often exclude individuals without formal income or credit history. With PalSave Circles:
- Users generate verifiable financial behavior data.
- The platform evaluates creditworthiness based on community participation and payment discipline.
- It promotes **financial inclusion** through **behavior-driven scoring**.
